# olam-project

This project is intended to complement the "[Oracle Linux Automation Manager](https://github.com/etho201/vagrant-boxes/tree/main/oracle-linux-automation-manager)" project found in the [etho201/vagrant-boxes](https://github.com/etho201/vagrant-boxes) repo.

> **NOTE:** In this sample project, the Ansible Vault password is `Password1`, and that is used to decrypt the `admin_secret` password contained in `secrets.yml`.
